## Cloud Forcasting Transformer

Our work tackles the problem of cloud cover nowcasting using Deep Learning. Nowcasting is a field of meteorology which aims at forecasting weather for a short term of up to
a few hours. Cloud cover, as the name suggests, refers the fraction of the sky covered by clouds at some geographical location. Our work bases on the Earthformer, a transformer model created by Amazon science. 
We train the Earthformer on our original dataset composed of satellite images provided by the Israeli Meteorological Service.

The model's input is a sequence of 13 satellite images taken 15 minutes apart. The model's output is 12 images that
represent the prediction of the next satellite images following the input sequence.

## Installation
### Training
Install CUDA (We had CUDA 11.7 or 11.8 installed): https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

Clone the repository and install requirements:
```
git clone https://github.com/leahandofir/cloud-forecasting-transformer.git
cd cloud-forecasting-transformer
pip install -r train_requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -U -e . --no-build-isolation --extra-index-url --trusted-host
```

Set up wandb if used:
```
pip install wandb
wandb login
```

### Inferencing
The inference was tested on windows only.
Clone the repository and install requirements:
```
git clone https://github.com/leahandofir/cloud-forecasting-transformer.git
cd cloud-forecasting-transformer
pip install -r inference_requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -U -e . --no-build-isolation --extra-index-url --trusted-host
```
Run inference script at scripts/cuboid_transformer/ims/ims_inference.py.
